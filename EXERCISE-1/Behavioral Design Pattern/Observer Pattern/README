The Observer pattern is implemented in this code by defining a relationship between the WeatherStation (subject) and WeatherDisplay (observer) classes, where the WeatherStation notifies the WeatherDisplay of any changes in weather measurements.
Here is how each component works:
Components of the Observer Pattern in the Code
1.Subject Interface (WeatherSubject):
  This interface defines methods for adding, removing, and notifying observers.
2.Observer Interface (WeatherObserver):
  This interface defines the update method that will be called to notify the observer of changes.
3.Concrete Subject (WeatherStation):
  This class implements the WeatherSubject interface and maintains a list of observers.
  It also contains methods to set weather measurements, which trigger the notification of observers.
4.Concrete Observer (WeatherDisplay):
  This class implements the WeatherObserver interface and defines the update method to display the weather updates.
